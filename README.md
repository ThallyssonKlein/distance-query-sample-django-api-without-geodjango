# Sample code for study

This code is intended for use in development, not production. It was not made to perform, it was made to work.

## Why?

I faced difficulties to query distances with django using sqlite and without geodjango.

**Ps:** For reasons of Github security policies, I cannot keep the django secret exposed. For this code to work create a .env at the root of the directory and set DJANGO_SECRET=[your secret]
